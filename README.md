# Bearcat_Walking
 This script adjusts the walking and running speed of the player's character in a game. It runs continuously in the background and checks if the player is on foot, then adjusts the speed based on whether they are running or walking. It runs repeatedly with a very short delay of 0.01 ms to ensure smooth movement.
